# REACT - Zustand - Nested State Management

    Zustand is a REACT state management tool like redux but much easier, here the objective was to work with nested objects.

 >   Note: the example had a single user as its state, modified it to users array and pulled data from randomuser.me/api so it was mostly like merging two examples from documentation, todo app and nested state structure. Please notice the nested object (from random user API)

## ðŸ“Š Component Analysis

- **SelectUser**: âœ… Gets `users` from store, receives only necessary props
- **CurrentUser**: âœ… Gets `users` from store, receives only necessary props  
- **UpdateUserForm**: âœ… Already clean - only receives form-related props
- **UpdateAddressForm**: âœ… Already clean - only receives form-related props
- **App.jsx**: âœ… Still needs `users` from store for initialization and updates

## ðŸŽ¯ Zustand Best Practices

This project follows Zustand best practices:

1. **Global state** â†’ Import directly from store
2. **Local state** â†’ Pass as props only when necessary
3. **No prop drilling** â†’ Components get exactly what they need

This is exactly what state management tools like Zustand are designed for - eliminating unnecessary prop passing while keeping the necessary communication between components clean!
